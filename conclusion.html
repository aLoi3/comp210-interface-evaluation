          <h2>Overall, doing such evaluation was very useful for the game and for general experience. 
		  It suggested many improvements to the game that could 
		  make better player experience, which could make the game more enjoyable to play. 
		  Also this research will help not to make same mistakes in my future projects as well as 
		  improve current experience of evaluating games.
		  This research could also be tried to be made with other methods, such as task analysis or A/B testing. 
		  Thus, combining different methods could give even better feedback on a game.
		  Doing so would give better understanding of problems of the project I might be doing evaluation on. 
		  But nevertheless, it was a great learning experience, that I could use in the future.</h2>
