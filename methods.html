		<h1> Heuristic Evaluation </h1>
        <h2> Ultimate expert Ryan Clarke, Prime expert Adrian Carter and Divine expert Thomas Gilchrist will take part
in evaluating the game using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cxp_uOVHh3aYlNJ4SSyItyPdPgsNeHKMhPpK_qZYNvE/edit">evaluation sheet</a> I created specifically for this game. 
This part focuses on the experts evaluating the main parts of the game, which are: </br>
</br>
1. Gameplay; </br>
2. Mechanics; </br>
3. Artificial Intellifence; </br>
4. Game Story Immersion; </br>
5. Difficulty; </br>
6. Environment Aesthetics; </br>
7. User Interface. </br>
</br>
As the game itself is not entirely finished, getting such feedback would improve further work on the game. 
In addition, using this evaluation method together with my second method, which is think aloud, this will be 
significant feedback.

		<h1> Think Aloud Method </h1>
          <h2> In addition to heuristic evaluation, I will be 
using think aloud method, which is considered as one of the sub-methods to psycho-physiological method. 
I was researching this method and wrote it in more depth in <a href="references/MethodsResearch.pdf">my paper</a>.
Basically, it requires a camera behind an expert that records whatever the expert says. Although I was using 
a camera placed in front of a computer, as I didn't have appropriate equipment, where face of a tester is still hidden 
and only voice is recorded. Experts in such method have to 
include their impressions about the game, how they feel while playing it, what events made them feel 
most emotional. This method should not take more than 10 minutes, as the game itself is not 
completely finished and saying what on one's mind while playing a game for a long period of time could 
impact the player experience negatively, which was discussed <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/35627848/7_samplePaper1.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1540382700&Signature=BuviCzqwntlKhghoT6wTYoYavNQ%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DCombining_Think-aloud_and_Physiological.pdf">here</a>, 
and therefore unnecessary or dishonest feedback would be given. </br>
</br>
I chose this method because human's emotions are hard to fake when they are concentrated on one activity. 
This was stated in this <a href="http://hcigames.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Games-User-Research-and-Physiological-Game-Evaluation.pdf">paper</a>. 
Therefore using one of the psycho-physiological methods could give useful feedback regarding our game. 
Getting honest feedback from player is always useful and thus the game can be changed to give better experience 
to the user. In addition, getting such feedback from previous projects will help in my future ones.</h2>
