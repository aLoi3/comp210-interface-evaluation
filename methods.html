in evaluating the game. </h2>

          <h2> Think aloud (needs a camera behind the expert) - In addition to heuristic evaluation, I will be 
using think aloud method, which is considered as one of the sub-methods to psycho-physiological method. 
It requires a camera behind an expert that records whatever the expert says. And the expert has to 
include his/her impressions about the game, how he/she feels while playing it, what events made him/her feel 
most emotional? This method should not take more than 10 minutes, as the game itself is not 
completely finished and saying what on one's mind while playing a game for a long period of time 
ruins player experience and therefore unnecessary or dishonest feedback will be given. </h2>
