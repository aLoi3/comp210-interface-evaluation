          <h2> Results gave useful feedback in terms of how to improve this game. Even though it had many 
			different problems, overall experience of the player is good. Testers like intuitive controls, 
			which is very important in this case. They also loved the environment and how consistent throughout the 
			game it is, although some improvements were suggested, such as adding more colors. Also, we tried 
			making this game somewhat hard, but failed balancing it so that it feels challenging but at the same time 
			not frustrating to complete the game. Nevertheless, I got great feedback and could point out major 
			issues that could be fixed in the first place.</h2>

		<h1> Recommendations </h1>
          <h2> The major problems I gathered from these methods are mainly based on artificial intelligence, user 
			interface difficulty/balancing  of the game. These are recommendations I would concentrate on changing: </br>
			</br>
			1. Improve artificial intelligence as it is main part of the game. Doing so, will first of all 
			make the game more difficult in some aspects, but also change the way the player would play 
			to complete the game. </br>
			2. Change user interface - making health bar more visible to player will let him/her see this component more 
			clearly, so he/she doesn't need to be distracted by that while fighting lots of enemies. As it is bullet-hell type 
			of game, health is an important component that player has to see all the time to know in what danger he/she might be. </br>
			3. Find the middle ground of difficulty of the game. The game should be challenging, but not frustrating 
			for the player. That way it could become more engaging, as balancing the game is difficult problem to solve. 
			It could be simple parameter changes or entirely different AI system that enemies going to use, which is 
			much more difficult to make. </br>
			</br>
			These are my personal thoughts about game improvements related to the feedback I was given. In addition, 
			these are major improvements that could be made, whereas there are much more minor issues with the game. 
			And these are best discussed with the team itself, which can't actually be done at the moment, as it was 
			first year project. But for the sake of learning, this is of great use for current year project in terms of 
			playtesting and getting feedback from other members of Games Academy.
