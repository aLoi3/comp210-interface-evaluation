		<h1> Heuristic and think aloud results </h1>
          <h2> Results show very different feedback. Both heuristics and think aloud methods have various 
		  suggestions, but some of them are similar in terms of improvements. First impressions of all the subjects 
		  that have played the game were made about main menu, shich had only two buttons - Play and Quit. 
		  As the game was just a demo-like, we haven't done anything further than that, for example options, 
		  that players can change to best fit their style of playing. </br>
		  </br>
		  Second issue that appeared at the beginning of the test was narrative. At the start there is a hologram 
		  of the antagonist and it talks to the player, occasionally making jokes. But there was too much text 
		  and players didn't like just reading it all. Several improvements were suggested for this issue. 
		  That was adding voice acting, which we couldn't afford, or add colors to speakers, which could make 
		  a small visual difference. </br>
		  </br>
		  In terms of gameplay, several problems were issued. Those are fighting shield-type enemies - it was 
		  taking too much time fighting them. In my opinion, this issue could be fixed by making their health lower 
		  or making damage they take higher to compensate time players use to defeat them. Also, two of the experts 
		  pointed out that aiming was feeling slightly off, which made it feel a bit weird to shoot accurately. 
		  One of the bigger suggestions made by an expert was trying adding a twin stick game controller, which 
		  could make the game controls feel more intuitive. Also, having small health bar at the top-left corner 
		  was too far too look at. As the gameplay is quite intense, one has to avoid lots of bullets and defeat enemies, 
		  looking at one's health is important. So, changing its size and location would make some difference to player 
		  experience.</br>
		  </br>
		  Mechanic-wise testers issued a couple points. One of which is charging weapon with shield successfully 
		  reflecting enemy bullets felt slow. Even though it rewarded the player with one-shot-one-kill bullet, 
		  spamming left mouse button felt easier and faster in killing enemies. Also, one of the experts 
		  was using shield constantly and firing powerful bullets as soon as he got maximum charge. But 
		  he was using it by swaping between shield back to gun very fast, which caused the gun not to fire. 
		  This made him feel a bit dissapointed. </br>
		  </br>
		  As this game was mostly based on combat, artificial intelligence was a big concern during development time. 
		  Having three types of enemies was fine for such a short game, but one suggestion was made by an expert. 
		  This was making enemies shoot where the player was moving instead of where he was at the time enemies shot. 
		  It could stop players from just running past enemies to the end point and force them to either fight or 
		  maneuver, thinking about where would be the  best place to avoid bullets. This could be a significant 
		  improvement, as the game is partly a bullet-hell based. </br>
		  </br>
		  The only part of the game testers had no complains about was environment aesthetics. Aesthetics were consistent 
		  throughout the map and some of the visuals fitted well to the game. As we had camera rotation, players wanted 
		  to view the world from different angles.</h2>
