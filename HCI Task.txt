Where can I get camera? Can I use my phone ?

Notes: 
fxplus studyhub -> written assignments -> writing for science -> scientific reports -> 
-> look into how and what paragraphs should be written about. Particularly introduction, materials and 
methods, results, discussion.

Ultimate expert Ryan Clarke and Prime expert Adrian Carter

Introduction:
1) Demiurge is a first year project that I took part in developing. Mainly focusing on AI development, 
but also having implemented some character mechanics. It's an top-down, sci-fi RPG with elements
of bullet-hell mechanic and story.

Player has crash landed on an unknown planet, which he wants to get out of. But the antagonist decided
that the player intends to take over his powers. Being very clumsy, he's trying to scare the player 
away, but only makes himself lose authority as a planet ruler.

Methods:
1) Heuristic Evaluation - Ultimate expert Ryan Clarke, Prime expert Adrian Carter and ... will take part
in evaluating the game.

2) Think aloud (needs a camera behind the expert) - In addition to heuristic evaluation, I will be 
using think aloud method, which is considered as one of the sub-methods to psychophysiological method. 
It requires a camera behind an expert that records whetever the expert says. And the expert has to 
... his/her impressions about the game, how he/she feels while playing it, what events made him/her feel 
most emotions...? This method should not take more than 10 minutes, as the game itself is not 
completely finished and saying what one's feeling while playing a game for a long period of time 
ruins player experience and therefore unnecessary or unhonest feedback will be given.
